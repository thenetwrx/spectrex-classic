      <p class="opacity-75">
        This document covers proper etiquette when you submit your Discord
        server to Spectrex.
      </p>

      <p class="text-3xl">1. Inappropriate content</p>
      <p class="opacity-75">
        The inclusion of profanity, vulgar language, or NSFW (Not Safe For Work)
        content within the meta-information (such as title, description, and
        image), reviews, or any other visible content on Spectrex is strictly
        prohibited. Such content will be promptly removed from the platform.
        However, users are encouraged to repost their content using appropriate
        and respectful language.
      </p>

      <p class="text-3xl">2. Governing laws</p>
      <p class="opacity-75">
        You may not violate any laws or regulations in your country of residence
        or promote the violation of them.
      </p>

      <p class="text-3xl">3. Discord Community Guidelines</p>
      <p class="opacity-75">

        are not allowed.
      </p>

      <p class="text-3xl">4. Automation</p>
      <p class="opacity-75">
        The use of bots or other scripts to automatically do actions on Spectrex
        such as bumping a server ("auto-bump") is not allowed. Bumping, creating
        reviews and etc. must be done manually.
      </p>

      <p class="text-3xl">5. Spam</p>
      <p class="opacity-75">
        You may not list servers which serve for the sole purpose of redirecting
        or advertising other servers or have no content (To our discretion).
      </p>

      <p class="text-3xl">6. Rewarding users</p>
      <p class="opacity-75">
        You may not reward or force users to do actions in Spectrex. For
        instance, you may not reward your users for posting a nice review on a
        server or force them to bump a server.
      </p>

      <p class="text-3xl">7. Reviews</p>
      <p class="opacity-75">
        You may not use multiple Discord accounts to submit multiple reviews.
        Only 1 review per person.
      </p>

      <p class="text-3xl">8. Sexual content</p>
      <p class="opacity-75">
        All servers which are mainly based on NSFW (Not safe for work) or sexual
        content must be marked as "NSFW" on Spectrex. This does not exclude
        section 1.
