          authorized to grant all permissions and licenses provided in these
          Terms and bind the entity to these Terms, and that you agree to these

      </p>
      <p class="text-3xl">7. Disclaimers</p>
      <p class="opacity-75">
        The Products and all included content are provided on an "as is" basis
        without warranty of any kind, whether express or implied. SPECTREX
        SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS OF
        MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT,
        AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.
        Spectrex takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any User
        Content that you or any other user or third party posts or transmits
        using our Products. You understand and agree that you may be exposed to
        User Content that is inaccurate, objectionable, inappropriate for
        children, or otherwise unsuited to your purpose. Unfortunately, people
        post bad stuff on user-generated content sites like Spectrex. We take
        that kind of thing seriously but you still might run into it before we
        have a chance to take it down. If you see bad stuff, please report it to
        us.
      </p>
      <p class="text-3xl">8. Limitation of liability</p>
      <p class="opacity-75">
        TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, SPECTREX SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR
        ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR
        ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR
        INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOOD-WILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE
        LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (A) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO
        ACCESS OR USE THE PRODUCTS; (B) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD
        PARTY ON THE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DEFAMATORY,
        OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES; OR (C)
        UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT.

      <p class="text-3xl">9. Dispute Resolution</p>
      <p class="opacity-75">
        For any dispute you have with Spectrex, you agree to first contact us
        and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. If Spectrex has
        not been able to resolve the dispute with you informally, we each agree
        to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding claims for
        injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection
        with or relating to these Terms under the exclusive jurisdiction of the
        Courts in Indianapolis, Indiana. Nothing in this Section shall prevent
        either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the
        courts for matters related to data security, intellectual property or
        unauthorized access to the Service. ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE
        PARTIES' INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN
        ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE
        OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S
        CLAIMS.

        These Terms shall be governed by the laws of The United States of
        America and are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of
        Indianapolis, Indiana.

      <p class="text-3xl">11. General terms</p>
      <p class="opacity-75">
        Notification procedures and changes to these Terms Spectrex reserves the
        right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to you,
        and you agree to receive legal notices electronically if we so choose.
        We may revise these Terms from time to time and the most current version
        will always be posted on our website. If a revision, in our sole
        discretion, is material we will notify you. By continuing to access or
        use the Products after revisions become effective, you agree to be bound
        by the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop
        using the Products.
      </p>
      <p class="text-3xl">Assignment</p>
      <p class="opacity-75">
        These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be
        transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Spectrex without
        restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof
        shall be null and void.
      </p>
      <p class="text-3xl">Entire agreement/severability</p>
      <p class="opacity-75">
        These Terms, together with the Privacy policy and any amendments and any
        additional agreements you may enter into with Spectrex in connection
        with the Products, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and
        Spectrex concerning the Products. If any provision of these Terms is
        deemed invalid, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the
        minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms
        will remain in full force and effect.
      </p>
      <p class="text-3xl">No waiver</p>
      <p class="opacity-75">
        No waiver of any term of these Terms shall be deemed a further or
        continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Spectrex's failure
        to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute
        a waiver of such right or provision.
